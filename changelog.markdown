# Changelog
## 3.3
## 3.3.2
Change behaviour of Capybara; having `:start_local_application = false` in your Sauce.config will now let Capybara control whether or not it should start a server.
Made the #page method smarter at figuring out if it should return the Selenium object or the Capybara object.
RSpec < 2 will now report job success or failure
You can pass a hash to Sauce::Config.new including `:without_defaults => true` and uh, defaults won't be loaded.
Added a check if Sauce Connect can't connect to Sauce's servers.
Added check if parallel\_tests is already running/didn't quit.
Make Capybara always include the port for local rack applications.
Defaulted Capybara to using a Sauce Connect port.
